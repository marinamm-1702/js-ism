{"name":"J-ISM","tagline":"A simple Javascript ice sheet model","body":"## About ##\r\n\r\nJ-ISM (Javascript Ice Sheet Model) is an educational numerical model of the Greenland and East Antarctic ice sheets, which runs interactively in a browser. The model allows users to simulate the behaviour of both ice sheets under different climate scenarios, as well as to look at the effects of different physical processes on the results. \r\n\r\nNumerically, the model is a reimplementation of Frank Pattyn's Excel-based GRANTISM - a flowline model using the Shallow Ice Approximation. It includes basal sliding and isostatic adjustment of the bedrock, as well as simplified models of thermomechanical coupling and sea level adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe model is designed so that it should be easy to provide different interfaces for different classes of user, with some basic knowledge of HTML. A sample interface is provided.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies ##\r\n\r\nThe following external libraries are used by the model, and included in the `external` directory. You may want to replace them with your own locally installed copies (particularly jQuery).\r\n\r\n * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n * [jQuery Simple Slider](http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/)\r\n * [Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
